# Truss-Me

## Overview

Truss-Me is a simple finite elements program for designing
and analyzing 3D truss structres composed of 2-node bar 
elements under applied forcing conditions and 
degree-of-freedom constraints. It is part of my Programming 
Tutorial series for demonstrating software implementations
of useful concepts from physics, engineering, and mathematics.

The example problem in `truss-me.ipynb`, as well as the plotting
utilities used here, are closely based on materials (see Exercise 21.5) 
from Introduction to Finite Element Methods" by C. Felippa, who taught 
a graduate course on the subject when I was a student at CU Boulder. 
The original implementation of this problem in the context of 
displacement method solutions can be found in Fox & Schmit (1964).
